        <p>
          New Zealand is an island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmasses – that of the North Island,
          or Te Ika-a-Māui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamu – and numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some 1,500 kilometres (900 mi) east of
          Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly 1,000 kilometres (600 mi) south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of
          its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long isolation, New Zealand developed a distinctive biodiversity of animal,
          fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of
          land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Somewhere between 1250 and 1300 CE, Polynesians settled in the islands that were to become New Zealand, and developed a distinctive Māori culture.
          In 1642, Abel Tasman, a Dutch explorer, became the first European to sight New Zealand. In 1840, representatives of the British Crown and Māori
          Chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi, making New Zealand a British colony. Today, the majority of New Zealand's population of 4.5 million is of
          European descent; the indigenous Māori are the largest minority, followed by Asians and Pacific Islanders. Reflecting this, New Zealand's culture
          is mainly derived from Māori and early British settlers, with recent broadening arising from increased immigration. The official languages are English,
          Māori and New Zealand Sign Language, with English predominant.
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          New Zealand is a developed country with a market economy that is dominated by the exports of dairy products, meat and wine, along with tourism.
          New Zealand is a World Bank high-income economy and ranks highly in international comparisons of national performance, such as health, education,
          economic freedom and quality of life. Nationally, legislative authority is vested in an elected, unicameral Parliament, while executive political
          power is exercised by the Cabinet, led by the Prime Minister, who is currently John Key. Queen Elizabeth II is the country's head of state and is
          represented by a Governor-General. In addition, New Zealand is organised into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial authorities for local government
          purposes. New Zealand is a member of the United Nations, Commonwealth of Nations, ANZUS, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,
          Pacific Islands Forum, and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.

        <p>
          The countryside of New Zealand is unique and quite spectacular, from rolling green hills to golden sand beaches then lush rainforests, all within a
          few hours' drive. New Zealand has just over four million people, known affectionately as ‘Kiwis’, who are easy going, warm and welcoming to their
          neighbors and to those who travel to experience all that is New Zealand. New Zealanders travel overseas a lot and this means they are well used
          to a range of cultures. New Zealand itself is a multi-cultural nation, with a fusion of Maori (the indigenous people), Pacific Island, European
          and Asian people combining to make a vibrant and colorful society.
          New Zealand also has an international reputation as a provider of quality education. It offers a safe learning environment which provides excellent
          study opportunities and support services for international students. Courses are available for academic, professional and vocational studies at universities,
          polytechnics, colleges of education, secondary schools and private training establishments. New Zealanders are well travelled, with a great interest in people
          from other cultures, so visitors and international students soon feel more than welcome. Campuses are highly international, with students from all corners of
          the globe studying and socialising together. Students come from Europe, South East Asia, the UK, North Asia, Japan, South America, India, and Australia,
          amongst many others. New Zealand offers a progressive education to help students take a leading place in the exciting global environment, with many
          New Zealanders working internationally or involved in collaborative research with many prestigious overseas universities.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          There are many state-of-the-art facilities, and with many institutions spearheading several new technological developments, students have access
          to more advanced technology than they could wish for. As a result, New Zealand produces top graduates who can take their place in the international
          arena with confidence. New Zealand offers the best of both worlds: - the sophistication and excitement of a cosmopolitan country mixed with an easygoing
          lifestyle. Thousands of students are choosing to study here, to further their English, broaden their knowledge and improve their job prospects in
          the global marketplace.
