        India, officially the Republic of India is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country with over 1.32 billion people, and the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the south-west, and the Bay of Bengal on the south-east, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west, China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north-east; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; in addition, India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia.
        Home to the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation and a region of historic trade routes and vast empires, the Indian subcontinent was identified with its commercial and cultural wealth for much of its long history. Four religions—Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism—originated here, whereas Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam arrived in the 1st millennium CE and also shaped the region's diverse culture. Gradually annexed by and brought under the administration of the British East India Company from the early 18th century and administered directly by the United Kingdom after the Indian Rebellion of 1857, India became an independent nation in 1947 after a struggle for independence that was marked by non-violent resistance led by Mahatma Gandhi.
        Currently, the Indian economy is the world's seventh-largest by nominal GDP and third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP). Following market-based economic reforms in 1991, India became one of the fastest-growing major economies; it is considered a newly industrialised country. However, it continues to face the challenges of poverty, corruption, malnutrition, inadequate public healthcare, and terrorism. A nuclear weapons state and a regional power, it has the third-largest standing army in the world and ranks sixth in military expenditure among nations. India is a federal republic governed under a parliamentary system consisting of 29 states and 7 union territories. India is a pluralistic, multilingual, and a multi-ethnic society. It is also home to a diversity of wildlife in a variety of protected habitats.
        India has been a major seat of learning for thousands of years. The country was home to both Takshashila - the first university in the world, and to the inventor of the digit 0 - Āryabhaṭa. Albert Einstein once said: "we owe a lot to the Indians who taught us how to count, without which no worthwhile scientific discovery could have been made". Today, India is known as a communication hub, and has become popular with international students from all over the world. It is highly attractive due to its forward thinking, its popularity with large multinational companies, and also due to English being the common language of communication.  According to Peter Drucker, "India is become a power house very fast, the medical school in New Delhi is now perhaps the best in the world.  The technical graduates of Indian Institute of Technology, Bangalore are as good as any in the world. Also India has 150 million people for whom English is their main language so India is indeed becoming a knowledge center".
        Indian universities and institutes of higher education and research have made significant contribution in research and development in the areas ranging from biotechnology to ocean engineering. In traditional subjects like arts and humanities, pure sciences, applied physics, chemistry, and mathematics, Indian universities and institutes of higher studies have been playing a leading role.
        The country has also been active in the development of space technology, production and launching of indigenous satellites and development of peaceful nuclear energy. Besides, India is also recognized the world over for its information technology talent.
        All these developments and initiatives have brought the country to the forefront as a technologically advanced nation. In fact, a large number of developing countries today look at India for training and guidance to further their development initiatives.
        The courses as well as professionals trained in Indian educational institutions are recognized the world over - 200 of the Fortune 500 companies regularly participate in campus placements in Indian institutions.
        Education in India has many benefits. Some of them are:
        Low Cost: The cost of education in India is quite low as compared to many other countries of the world.
        Quality Education: Indian educational institutions such as the IITs, IISc, IIMs, NITs, AIIMS, ISI, BITS and ISB are well known worldwide to provide quality education.
        Unique Courses: Apart from above mentioned advantages, one can also study some unique courses that were discovered and developed by the traditional knowledge system of India. Ayurveda, Sanskrit, Yoga and Hindi are some such courses that enthuse many international students.
        Financial Assistance: Various scholarships, education loans and other financial aids are available for studying in India today.
