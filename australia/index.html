        <p>
          Australia officially known as the Commonwealth of Australia, is an Oceanian country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent,
          the island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. Neighboring countries include
          Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east.
          For about 50,000 years before the first British settlement in the late 18th century, Australia was inhabited by indigenous Australians,
          who spoke languages grouped into roughly 250 language groups. After the European discovery of the continent by Dutch explorers in 1606,
          Australia's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain in 1770 and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South
          Wales from 26 January 1788. The population grew steadily in subsequent decades; the continent was explored and an additional five self-governing
          crown colonies were established. On 1 January 1901, the six colonies federated, forming the Commonwealth of Australia. Since federation,
          Australia has maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary democracy and constitutional
          monarchy comprising six states and several territories. Australia has six states—New South Wales (NSW), Queensland (QLD), South Australia (SA),
          Tasmania (TAS), Victoria (VIC) and Western Australia (WA)—and two major mainland territories—the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and the Northern
          Territory (NT). In most respects these two territories function as states, but the Commonwealth Parliament can override any legislation of their parliaments.
          By contrast, federal legislation overrides state legislation only in areas that are set out in Section 51 of the Australian Constitution; state
          parliaments retain all residual legislative powers, including those over schools, state police, the state judiciary, roads, public transport and
          local government, since these do not fall under the provisions listed in Section
        </p>

          Australia is a developed country and one of the wealthiest in the world, with the world's 12th-largest economy.
          In 2014 Australia had the world's fifth-highest per capita income. Australia's military expenditure is the world's 13th-largest.
          With the second-highest human development index globally, Australia ranks highly in many international comparisons of national performance,
          such as quality of life, health, education, economic freedom, and the protection of civil liberties and political rights. Australia is a member
          of the United Nations, G20, Commonwealth of Nations, ANZUS, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Trade Organization,
          Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, and the Pacific Islands Forum.

          Did you know Australia has the third highest number of international students in the world behind only the United Kingdom and the United States
          despite having a population of only 23 million? This isn’t surprising when you consider Australia has seven of the top 100 universities in the world!
          In fact, with over 22,000 courses across 1,100 institutions, Australia sits above the likes of Germany, the Netherlands and Japan,
          ranking eighth in the Universities 2012 U21 Ranking of National Higher Education Systems.
          These are strong academic credentials, but our institutions are just as highly rated as the cities that house them around the country.
          Australia has five of the 30 best cities in the world for students based on student mix, affordability, quality of life, and employer activity –
          all important elements for students when choosing the best study destination. And with more than a$200 million provided by the Australian Government
          each year in international scholarships, we’re making it easier for you to come and experience the difference an Australian education can make to your
          future career opportunities.
          Australia's aid program aims to help people in developing countries to lift themselves out of poverty and responds quickly when disaster strikes.
          The primary focus is the Asia–Pacific region, which has the world's highest concentration of people living in poverty. Australia also provides aid
          to developing countries in Africa and the Middle East.
          Do you have a specific study area of interest? There is every chance Australia has you covered, with at least one Australian university in the top
          50 worldwide across the study areas of Natural Sciences & Mathematics, Life & Agricultural Sciences, Clinical Medicine & Pharmacy, and Physics.
          Given this impressive education degree, it’s not surprising there are now more than 2.5 million former international students who have gone on to
          make a difference after studying in Australia. Some of these students are among the world’s finest minds. In fact, Australia has produced 15 Nobel
          prize laureates and every day over 1 billion people around the world rely on Australian discoveries and innovations – including penicillin, IVF,
          ultrasound, Wi-Fi, the Bionic Ear, cervical cancer vaccine and Black Box Flight Recorders – to make their lives, and the lives of others, better.
