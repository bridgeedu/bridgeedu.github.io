        The Netherlands is the main constituent country (Dutch: land) of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a small, densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom and Germany. The largest and most important cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, The Hague and Rotterdam. Amsterdam is the country's capital, while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament. The port of Rotterdam is the largest port in Europe – as large as the next three largest combined – and was the world's largest port between 1962 and 2004. The name Holland is also frequently used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the Netherlands.
        "Netherlands" literally means "lower countries", influenced by its low land and flat geography, with only about 50% of its land exceeding one metre above sea level. Most of the areas below sea level are man-made. Since the late 16th century, large areas (polders) have been reclaimed from the sea and lakes, amounting to nearly 17% of the country's current land mass. With a population density of 408 people per km2 – 500 if water is excluded – the Netherlands is a very densely populated country. Only Bangladesh, South Korea, and Taiwan have both a larger population and a higher population density. Nevertheless, the Netherlands is the world's second-largest exporter of food and agricultural products, after the United States. This is partly due to the fertility of the soil and the mild climate. The Netherlands was the third country in the world to have an elected parliament, and since 1848 it has been governed as a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy, organised as a unitary state. The Netherlands has a long history of social tolerance and is generally regarded as a liberal country, having legalised abortion, prostitution and euthanasia, while maintaining a progressive drugs policy. In 2001, it became the world's first country to legalize same-sex marriage.
        The Netherlands is a founding member of the EU, Eurozone, G-10, NATO, OECD and WTO, and a part of the trilateral Benelux Union. The country is host to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and five international courts: the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the International Court of Justice, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the International Criminal Court and the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. The first four are situated in The Hague, as is the EU's criminal intelligence agency Europol and judicial co-operation agency Eurojust. This has led to the city being dubbed "the world's legal capital". The Netherlands is also a part of the Schengen Area. The Netherlands has a market-based mixed economy, ranking 17th of 177 countries according to the Index of Economic Freedom. It had the thirteenth-highest per capita income in the world in 2013 according to the International Monetary Fund. In 2013, the United Nations World Happiness Report ranked the Netherlands as the seventh happiest country in the world, reflecting its high quality of life.
        Considering the country’s small size and significant European competition, the Netherlands’ higher education system packs a mighty punch. Dutch universities consistently earn top spots in international rankings based on everything from external funding to job prospects for graduates.One indication of the country’s rising power as a player in the international education market is the increasing number of international students seeking to study here, including a notable rise in students from outside the EU. Factor in that programs are high quality, widely offered in English and a comparative bargain, and these escalating numbers are no surprise. Long known for its multiculturalism, the Netherlands is more focused than ever on attracting international students thanks to the recent “Make it in The Netherlands” initiative. This comprehensive plan aims to engage more international students based on the conviction that a diverse student population boosts everything from employment success rates for all to an enhanced educational system.

        Employers also value international talent in the form of students, researchers and workers: to that end, more career options are being presented to international students, as well as increased opportunities for language learning. “Make it in The Netherlands” is also focused on reducing barriers between Dutch students and their international counterparts for increased collaboration. Gaining international work experience is essential when looking to enter today’s job market.Dutch Universities of Applied Sciences recognise the importance of real-world experience. In fact, it is impossible to gain a degree from such a university without completing at least one work placement. This placement may be in the Netherlands, back in the UK or in a completely different country. Dutch Universities of Applied Sciences offer comprehensive support and advice when trying to arrange the best placement for you.Dutch research universities place a higher emphasis on academic study but even here it is often possible to combine work experience with your studies and universities actively encourage this.
