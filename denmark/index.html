        Denmark is a Scandinavian country in the European Union. The southernmost of the Nordic countries, it is southwest of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is a sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has an area of 42,924 square kilometres (16,573 sq mi), and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands,of which around 70 are inhabited. The islands are characterized by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate.
        The unified kingdom of Denmark emerged in the 10th century as a proficient seafaring nation in the struggle for control of the Baltic Sea. Denmark, Sweden and Norway were ruled together under the Kalmar Union, established in 1397 and ending with Swedish secession in 1523. Denmark and Norway remained under the same monarch until the union was dissolved by outside forces in 1814. The deterioration of the Kingdom of Norway, caused by the Black Death, made it possible for Denmark to inherit an expansive colonial empire from this union—of which the Faroe Islands and Greenland are remnants. Beginning in the 17th century, there were several cessions of territory; these culminated in the 1830s with a surge of nationalist movements, which were defeated in the 1864 Second Schleswig War. Denmark remained neutral during World War I. In April 1940, a German invasion saw brief military skirmishes while the Danish resistance movement was active from 1943 until the German surrender in May 1945. An industrialized exporter of agricultural produce in the second half of the 19th century, Denmark introduced social and labour-market reforms in the early 20th century that created the basis for the present welfare state model with a highly developed mixed economy.
        The Constitution of Denmark was signed on 5 June 1849, ending the absolute monarchy which had begun in 1660. It establishes a constitutional monarchy—the current monarch is Queen Margrethe II—organised as a parliamentary democracy. The government and national parliament are seated in Copenhagen, the nation's capital, largest city and main commercial centre. Denmark exercises hegemonic influence in the Danish Realm, devolving powers to handle internal affairs. Denmark became a member of the European Economic Community in 1973, maintaining certain opt-outs; it retains its own currency, the krone. It is among the founding members of NATO, the Nordic Council, the OECD, OSCE, and the United Nations; it is also part of the Schengen Area.
        Danes enjoy a high standard of living and the country ranks highly in some metrics of national performance, including education, health care, and protection of civil liberties, democratic governance, prosperity and human development. The country ranks as having the world's highest social mobility, a high level of income equality, has one of the world's highest per capita incomes, the least corrupt country in the world, and has one of the world's highest personal income tax rates. A large majority of Danes are members of the National Church, though the Constitution guarantees freedom of religion.
        Denmark is a beautiful country that not many international students have discovered yet. It is part of the Schengen countries that consist of northern and Western Europe. However, according to QS Top Universities website which ranks its Best Student Cities, Copenhagen has been steadily climbing the chart and is now within the top 50 cities in the world. When they are old enough for college, every Dane is entitled to free tuition, thanks to their excellent educational system. They encourage freedom of choice. Whether they choose to study Gymnasium (academic upper secondary education), Higher Preparatory Education (one year shorter than Gymnasium), HTX (Higher Technical Education Program with emphasis on Mathematics and Engineering), HHX (Higher Commercial Examination Program with emphasis on trade and business), or vocational education that puts emphasis on learning a trade by apprenticeship and training, every student is encouraged to “think for themselves.” Innovation and creativity are prized qualities in the system.
        Denmark has eight universities. The largest is the University of Copenhagen which was founded in 1479. It’s also ranked #39 in the QS Top Universities’ “Best Student Cities” this year. Other prominent universities include the Aarhus University, and the University of Southern Denmark which is located in Odense, the birthplace of Hans Christian Andersen.For EU/EEA/Swiss students, tuition is free. For non-EU students, they offer scholarships and grants. For example, Erasmus Mundus offers a scholarship to specific Master’s degree programs.
        An academic tradition combining excellence with an innovative culture for both teaching and research; a typical class consisting of lectures as well as discussions in small groups; internationally oriented wide variety of programmes (that too in English); an open minded population with global outlook; institutions of higher education collaborating with business life and research institutions -- all this and much more creates an enriching learning environment. And that makes studies in Denmark a truly world class experience.
